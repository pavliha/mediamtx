  # Source of the stream. This can be:
  # * publisher -> the stream is provided by a RTSP, WebRTC client
  # * rtsp://existing-url -> the stream is pulled from another RTSP server / camera
  # * rtsps://existing-url -> the stream is pulled from another RTSP server / camera with RTSPS
  # * http://existing-url/stream.m3u8 -> the stream is pulled from another HLS server / camera
  # * https://existing-url/stream.m3u8 -> the stream is pulled from another HLS server / camera with HTTPS
  # * udp://ip:port -> the stream is pulled with UDP, by listening on the specified IP and port
  # * whep://existing-url -> the stream is pulled from another WebRTC server / camera
  # * wheps://existing-url -> the stream is pulled from another WebRTC server / camera with HTTPS
  # * redirect -> the stream is provided by another path or server
  # If path name is a regular expression, $G1, G2, etc will be replaced

# Path settings

# Settings in "paths" are applied to specific paths, and the map key
# is the name of the path.
# Any setting in "pathDefaults" can be overridden here.
# It's possible to use regular expressions by using a tilde as prefix,
# for example "~^(test1|test2)$" will match both "test1" and "test2",
# for example "~^prefix" will match all paths that start with "prefix".
paths:
  # example:
  camera:
     source: "rtsp://192.168.2.119:554"

  # Settings under path "all_others" are applied to all paths that
  # do not match another entry.
